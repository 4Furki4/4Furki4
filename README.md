## Here's My Story
> It's all started just for fun but with keep learning coding, I realized that not only can I have just fun, also I can make projects in my mind for my hobies and find a gateaway to find job without having bachelor's degree from Turkish Universities. Beginning of my coding experience, I had no goal and that's why I left coding several times. One of my hobies is exploring new archaic words in Turkish. TDK Dictionary is the only way to learn right definitions of the words and it has outdated website. I instinctively realized that this must be my goal. So to speak, I want to serve my knowledge to benefits of society. This is succinctly who I am :)

### Some other hobbies: 
* Playing video games since I was 5 y.o
* Biking <3 
* Vocabularies and etymology(on Turkish now)
* Neuroscience

### Skills
- C# and .NET Core Web Applications/Services (I really love APIs and wanna speciliaze myself in it)
- EF Core, MySQL, MSSQL and Redis
- Unity: I exprecienced somewhat 
- FrontEnd: HTML, CSS (BootStrap), JavaScript, TypeScript and Angular
- Docker (Basic)

--------------------------------

## ___Last But Not Least - WHAT IS MY GOAL ?___
   ðŸ˜Š I really wanna be a full stack web dev and solve my own problems that comes to my mind (currently learning .NET 7 Web Application and Client-Side features like Angular) independently. ðŸŒ±)
