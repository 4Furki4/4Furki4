## Here's My Story
>Hello there!
>
>I'm currently learning web development: both backend and frontend. I don't have any background like a degree unrelated to development. My web development adventure started as a hobby, then became the reason why I dropped out of university. I actually wanted to make my games using Unity. However, I decided to build a new Turkish online dictionary because of the downsides of the official TDK dictionary. But why would I build it ? It's because I love the meanings and etymologies of Turkish words. I kept learning to build it, then realized that web development becomes beyond a hobby because I mostly spend my whole time learning new things for it.

### Some other hobbies: 
* Playing video games since I was 5 y.o
* Biking <3 
* Vocabularies and etymology(on Turkish now)
* Neuroscience

### Skills
- C# and .NET Core Web Applications/Services (I really love APIs and wanna specialize in them)
- EF Core, MySQL, MSSQL, Redis, and MongoDB
- Unity: I experienced somewhat 
- FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript
  - Frameworks: Angular and Next.js
- Docker (Basic)
- SignalR
