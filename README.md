## Here's My Story
>Hello there!
>
>I am currently pursuing web development, with a focus on both backend and frontend. Despite not having a background in this field or a degree, I started this journey as a hobby and it quickly became my passion. In fact, I even dropped out of university to pursue it further. My initial plan was to create games using Unity, but I ended up building a new Turkish online dictionary due to my love for the meanings and etymologies of Turkish words. I continued to learn and work on it, and soon web development became more than just a hobby, as I found myself dedicating most of my time to learning new skills and techniques.

### Some other hobbies: 
* Playing video games since I was 5 y.o
* Biking <3 
* Vocabularies and etymology(on Turkish now)
* Neuroscience

### Skills
- C# and .NET Core Web Applications/Services (I really love APIs and wanna specialize in them)
- EF Core, MySQL, MSSQL, Redis, and MongoDB
- Unity: I experienced somewhat 
- FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript
  - Frameworks: Angular and Next.js
- Docker (Basic)
- SignalR
